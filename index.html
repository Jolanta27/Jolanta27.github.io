                <p>I startet my journey with frontend development for to years ago and coding has been my new hobby and
                    passion from that day. As I go forward in this process, I enjoy looking back and seeing where I have
                    been a week ago, a month ago.</p>
                <p>I enjoy creating simple, clean and creative user interfaces using the latest web technologies.</p>
                <p>I have just scratched the surface, but I am excited to see what new opportunities await me in the
                    future. I hope you can help me to get there by working together! &#128516;</p>
                <p>I'm currently looking for new opportunities and my inbox is always open. Whether you have a question
                    or just want to say hi, I'll try my best to get back to you!</p>

                            them, and don't give up. It'll be worth in the end! Learn, test, strive to improve. You
                            don’t fail unless you quit.</q></p>
